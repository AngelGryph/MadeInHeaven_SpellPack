Kit library

Action functions

find_clab (str kit -> str clab)

Returns the clab file associated with the kit or baseline class, or "unknown_clab" if none exists.

edit_clab ([str clab, str kit, arrowlist editstring, str edits])

Editor for clab files. Applies the list of patches to the clab file belonging to "kit" (looked up in column 1 of kitlist.2da, or failing that in class.ids), or if "kit" is unspecified, to the named clab file.

Although edit_clab has a similar-looking syntax to other SFO editors, it is much more rudimentary and does not have the full function=>expression power. Patch commands are hardcoded and limited to the following:

   * apply=>"[spell] [lvl]"  -  apply the listed spell at level "lvl". 

   * apply=>"[spell] [lvl] [rec]"  -  applies the listed spell at level "lvl" and every "rec" levels thereafter. 

   * grant=>"[spell] [lvl]"  -  grant the listed spell at level "lvl".

   * grant=>"[spell] [lvl] [rec]"  -  grant the listed spell at level "lvl" and every "rec" levels thereafter.

   * remove=>"[spell] [lvl]"  -  removes the (granted or applied) spell at level "lvl". "spell" may be either an entry in SPELL.ids or a filename.

   * remove=>[spell]  -  removes the (granted or applied) spell at all levels
