Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This improved version of Dispel Magic will end any and all dispelable magical effects around the caster from friends and foes alike.  Unlike Dispel Magic there is no level-based contest; anything that can be dispelled will be, including effects from potions and wands.  Note that the caster is the center of effect and thus will be subject of having <PRO_HISHER> own magical protections dispelled.  This may leave <PRO_HIMHER> vulnerable to attack, so this spell should be used with utmost care.~

This improved version of Cloudkill creates a billowing cloud of horrendously toxic vapors.  Creatures with 10 hd or less are instantly slain with no saving throw unless they are immune to poison.
