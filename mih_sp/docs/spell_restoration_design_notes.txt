Design notes of the spells I restored, for the curious.  Unless noted
otherwise, this refers to vanilla (non-EE) BG2 files.


WIZARD_REVEAL_MAGIC

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2121
- dialog.tlk entries: 4653 (name), 25869 (name), 25870 (incomplete desc)
- working opcode #225 Reveal Magic

Deduced scroll item: scrl6b (logical order)

P&P source: Canon FR spell (Wizard's Compendium)

This one was a straightforward implement as all the necessary elements except
spell icons (my worst nemesis) were there and its P&P description was readily
translated into engine terms.  I basically just edited Detect Evil.


WIZARD_PROTECTION_CIRCLE

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2122
- dialog.tlk entries: 4654 (name), 34643 (incomplete desc)
- mentioned in description of Breach (25915)

Deduced scroll item: scrl6c (logical order)

P&P source: Not found

This one and its clerical counterpart Circle of Protection baffled me, as I
had no official source for them, or anything even close to it.  All I could
deduce is that it was a combat protection of some sort, so I decided to make
it give an AC bonus.  This might change if I can find an official source for
it.

There was no icon for this one, so I used the one for the cleric Circle of
Protection which does have bam files.


WIZARD_FOG_CLOUD

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2204 WIZARD_FOG_CLOUD
- icon files: spwi204a.bam, spwi204b.bam, spwi204c.bam, iscrl88.bam
- dialog.tlk entries: 12055 (name), 12965 (name), 13034 (name)

Deduced scroll item: scrl88 (icon present)

P&P source: Core spell (PHB)

One of my first restorations, as this one was already in the original Baldur's
Gate 1.  Since the cloud obscures sight both into and out of it, I settled for
making everyone in it both invisible and blinded.

Note: Surprisingly effective at thwarting enemy archers!


WIZARD_WRAITH_FORM

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2315
- icon files: spwi315a.bam, spwi315b.bam, spwi315c.bam, iscrl1r.bam
- dialog.tlk entries: 12020 (name), 12995 (name), 12144 (desc), 13065 (name)

Deduced scroll item: scrl1r (icon present)

P&P source: Core spell (PHB)

One of the most well known dummied out spells restored by several mods
including UB, one of the oldest ones around.  In vanilla BG1, it even had a
working spell file, which made restoring this one quite easy.

Note: May have been cut for balance reasons.  Very effective against many BG1
enemies, especially by a fighter/mage.


WIZARD_DIMENSION_DOOR

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2402
- working spell file: spwi402.spl
- icon files: spwi402a.bam, spwi402b.bam, spwi402c.bam, iscrl1v.bam
- dialog.tlk entries: 12082 (name), 12192 (desc), 12999 (name), 13069 (name)

Deduced scroll item: scrl1v (item and icon present)

P&P source: Core spell (PHB)

The most complete dummied out spell in BG2, probably because it was working
and normally available in BG1.  It only needed a few small updates to be
viable again.

Note: Probably dummied out because of the many ways in which careless use can
screw up your game.  Use at your own risk!


WIZARD_MONSTER_SUMMONING_4

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2610
- table file: monsum04.2da
- dialog.tlk entries: 16156 (name), 16165 (desc), 34580 (name)

Deduced scroll item: scrl7n (logical order)

P&P source: Core spell (PHB)

This one was really easy, I only had to edit another monster summoning spell 
nd provide one effect file.  Oh, and create a BG2 icon file.  I just recolored
an Icewind Dale one.

Note: Strings and tables for Monster Summoning V to VII are also present.
However, the tables are incomplete and corrupt, and there are no spell.ids
entries or obvious gaps for these spells.


WIZARD_TATTOOS_OF_POWER

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2709
- dialog.tlk entries: 25949 (name), 25950 (partial desc), 34601 (name)

Deduced scroll item: scrl8k (logical order)

P&P source: Not found.

There is no known seventh level spell by this name, but there is a 6th level
one called Tattoo of Power, used in arabian- and savage settings.  Seems also
appropriate to the Red Wizards to me.

Since this is another "container" spell and 7th level already has Spell
Sequencer, I decided to change its level to 6th.


WIZARD_OTTOS_IRRESISTABLE_DANCE

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2814
- dialog.tlk entries: 26274 (name), 34624 (name)

Deduced scroll item: scrl9i (logical order)

P&P source: Core spell (PHB)


WIZARD_SPELL_INVULNERABILITY

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 2901
- icon files: spwi901a.bam, spwi901b.bam, spwi901c.bam
- dialog.tlk entries: 26294 (name), 26296 (partial desc), 26301 (status
  message), 34626 (name)

Deduced scroll item: scrl9k (logical order)

P&P source: Not found.

The biggest challenge for this one was deciding what to make it do as I had
literally nothing to go on.  I may still change my mind on it.


CLERIC_CIRCLE_OF_PROTECTION

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 1112
- icon files: sppr112a.bam, sppr112b.bam, sppr112c.bam
- dialog.tlk entries: 25605 (name), 25606 (partial desc), 25868 (partial desc)

P&P source: Not found.

Like the wizard's Protection Circle, I could find no P&P source for this one.
I did find something just called Circle that gave a small AC bonus, so I went
with this.


CLERIC_ANIMAL_FRIENDSHIP

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 1114
- dialog.tlk entries: 38564 (name), 38565 (partial desc)

P&P source: Core spell (PHB)

Since priests already have Charm Animal, I decided to turn this into a minor
summoning spell to let a druid or ranger summon an animal companion for a
little while in the outdoors.


CLERIC_ENDURE_HEAT_COLD

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 1115
- dialog.tlk entries: 38566 (name)

P&P source: Core spell (PHB)

In P&P this is less powerful but lasts longer than Resist Fire/Cold, so I did
my best to reflect that in this version.


CLERIC_CURE_BLIND_DEAF

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- spell.ids entry: 1316
- dialog.tlk entries: 294 (name), 14072 (status), 14074 (status)
- icon files: sppr316a.bam, sppr316b.bam, sppr316c.bam

P&P source: Core spell (PHB)

The functionality of this spell was added to Cure Disease, making it
redundant.  I first decided to remove this function from Cure Disease, but
that gave unexpected AI problems, especially in Siege of Dragonspear.  So I
settled for altering it to a level 2 spell instead.


CLERIC_HOLY_SWORD

Proof that the spell was meant to be in the game:
- dialog.tlk entries: 6924 (name), 6925 (desc), 36485 (name), 36542 (name)
- hsword.itm: Incomplete item

P&P source: Not found.

Came across this one while searching for cleric spells in the Combat sphere.
Was a fairly simple matter to edit Flame Blade into this spell and restore the
item to working order.
