  <p><strong> Version 1 - <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/#mih_sp">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br />
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is my spell pack for Baldur's Gate 1 and -2.  It introduces several new arcane and divine spells to the game, as well as some new options for paladins.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games.
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  There are currently no known conflicts with other mods.  As for installation order, you should install the item pack fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br />
  If you have an older version of the MiH Spell Pack, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br />
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br />
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must run a program called 'modmerge' before installing any WeiDU mods like this one.  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br />
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
Made in Heaven: Spell Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_sp folder and setup-mih_sp.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_sp.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_sp.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_sp.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    Made in Heaven: Spell Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_sp folder, setup-mih_sp, and setup-mih_sp.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_sp.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (e.g. /usr/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_sp.debug mih_sp/setup-mih_sp.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Spell Pack are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br />
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod will have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component Descriptions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod consists of several components, each of which can be installed or removed independently from the others.<p>
  <p><strong>MiH Arcane Spell Pack</strong><br/>
  This installs new spells for wizards and bards.  The spells will be available on the selection screen when creating a new character, and spell scrolls are distributed throughout the environment.</p>
  <p><a href="arcane_spell_list.html">Arcane Spell List</a></p>
  <p><strong>MiH Divine Spell Pack</strong><br/>
  This installs new spells for clerics and druids.  The new spells will be added to the spell list as the characters level up, just like other spells for these classes.</p>
  <p><a href="divine_spell_list.html">Divine Spell List</a></p>
  <p><strong>Additional Paladin Powers</strong><br/>
  This gives paladins a few additional powers.  Most paladins can now use Smite Evil once per day (as in Icewind Dale), dealing 1d6 points of magical damage for every three levels of the paladin.  Undead Hunters instead gain Smite Undead, and Blackguards (EE only) gain Smite Good.  In addition to these, all paladins cwwho can Lay on Hands (true paladin and cavalier) will gain an extra use of this ability every seven levels.</p>
  <p><strong>Alaghar of Clangeddin Kit</strong><br/>
  This introduces a new priest kit, the Alaghar of Clangeddin, for dwarven priests.  When installed on BG1, Yeslick will recieve a modified version of this kit as well.</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Flame Blade</strong><br/>
  This component improves the Flame Blade spell, giving it roughly its 3.5e stats.  The Flame Blade is now wielded as a scimitar and deals 1d10 points of fire damage, +1 per level (max. +10).  It has +4 to hit, and counts as a +2 weapon for purposes of what it can hit.</p>
  <p><strong>Restored Cure Blindness/Deafness</strong><br/>
  This component restores the dummied out Cure Blindness/Deafness spell, separating this function from the Cure Disease spell.  The stronger Neutralize Poison will still retain its ability to cure blindness and deafness.</p>
  <p><strong>Correct Cleric/Druid Spell Use</strong><br/>
  This alters a few spells that clerics or druids should not have according to P&amp;P rules.  The current list of modified spells is as follows:</p>
  <table>
  <tr><th>Spell</th><th>Cleric?</th><th>Druid?</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Barkskin</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Doom</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Flame Blade</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Negative Plane Protection</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Protection from Fire</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Protection from Lightning</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Remove Curse</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Resist Fire and Cold</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Shillelagh</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>This list is based on spell lists in the Priests' Spell Compendium (2E).  Others may be added later</p>
</div>
<h2>The .ini File</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Within the mod folder, there is a file called setup-mih_sp.ini.  This file can be used to fine-tune certain aspects of this mod.  It is meant as an expert option, for normal installation you can leave this file as it is.  If you do edit this file, you must reinstall the mod, or at least the components whose settings you changed.</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th colspan=2>MiH Spell Arcane Pack</th></tr>
    <tr><td>place_spell_scrolls_in_bg1</td><td>Set to zero if you don't want new spell scrolls to show up in the original saga.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>place_spell_scrolls_in_sod</td><td>Set to zero if you don't want new spell scrolls to show up in Siege of Dragonspear.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>place_spell_scrolls_in_bg2</td><td>Set to zero if you don't want new spell scrolls to show up in Shadows of Amn.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>place_spell_scrolls_in_tob</td><td>Set to zero if you don't want new spell scrolls to show up in Throne of Bhaal.</td></tr>
