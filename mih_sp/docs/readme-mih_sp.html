  <p><strong>Version 7 - <a href="https://github.com/AngelGryph/MadeInHeaven_SpellPack/releases/">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br/>
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br/>
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is my spell pack for Baldur's Gate 1 and -2.  It introduces several new arcane and divine spells to the game, as well as some new options for paladins.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games.
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  The core components have no known compatibility issues with any mods.  The tweaks might conflict with other mods that do similar things, like Spell Revisions.  As a spell pack, this mod should be installed fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br/>
  If you have an older version of the MiH Spell Pack, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br/>
  <b>THIS MOD IS DEVELOPED ON ENHANCED EDITION AND NOT FREQUENTLY TESTED ON THE OLD ENGINE</b><br/>
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br/>
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must either run a 'modmerge' or install 'A7-DlcMerger' before installing this mod (or any WeiDU-based mods, really).  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br/>
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br/>
Made in Heaven: Spell Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_sp folder and setup-mih_sp.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_sp.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_sp.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_sp.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br/>
    Made in Heaven: Spell Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_sp folder, setup-mih_sp, and setup-mih_sp.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_sp.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br/>
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (e.g. /usr/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_sp.debug mih_sp/setup-mih_sp.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Spell Pack are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br/>
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod will have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>

  <p><i>Ramazith's Slime Summons</i> is an original creation by me.  All other spells are from the 2e PHB or official FR source books.</p>
  <p>Note: This component makes several changes to better match the game to known Forgotten Realms lore.  This can be turned off in the ini file if you really want to, but some things will then look strange.</p>
  <p>Note: Ninth level spell slots are actually fairly limited because the game also puts HLAs and a bunch of BS carried over from TotSC there.  This may make some spells unlearnable by sorcerers, although wizards can learn it from scrolls just fine.  For the EE games, the SFO library I use will try to solve this with some lua magic, but that option does not exist for the older games.  I have experimental code that will try to free up more 9th level slots, but it is untested and thus disabled by default.  See the ini file if you want to check it out.</p>

    <li>All good Paladins can cast Divine Favor once per day at level 3.  This extends to twice per day at level 10 and three times per day at level 17.  Divine Favor gives the paladin a small bonus to hit and damage.</li>
    <li>Paladins, Cavaliers and Inquisitors can Smite Evil once per day.  Undead Hunters can Smite Undead instead, and Blackguards can Smite Good.  The smite deals 1d6 magical damage for every 3 paladin levels.</li>
    <li>Paladins and Cavaliers gain an extra use of Lay on Hands every 7th level (max. 5 at level 28).</li>
    <li>Paladins and Cavaliers can Cure Disease once per day starting at 2nd level.  At 6th level they can do this twice per day.</li>
    <li>All Paladins can start casting divine spells at 4th level.</li>
    <li>Paladins can opt to gain an extra use of Lay on Hands (if they have it) or Smite Good/Evil/Undead as a high-level ability, up to three times for each.</li>
    <li>The Cavalier bonus against dragons has been extended to wyverns.</li>
    <li>All Paladins can achieve mastery (three stars) in "knightly" weapons like longswords, bastard swords, two-handed swords, flails, maces, warhammers and halberds.</li>

    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>This component nerfs the duration of the <i>Sleep</i> spell to a maximum of five rounds.  This was mostly out of frustration for having to wait for half my party to wake up after the Tarnesh battle at the FAI.  Five rounds is already a heck of a long time in combat, five rounds per level is just pure overkill.</p>

    <tr><th>Mod Compatibility</th><td>Cloak of Bravery is correctly reported to ToF's sphere system.<br>The change in working of <i>Remove Fear</i> may have some minor effect on SCS scripting.</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Design Notes</th><td>This is almost a restoration.</td></th>
    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>This component aims to make magical fear slightly more difficult to deal with and restore the purpose of the wizard's <i>Resist Fear</i> spell by nerfing the cleric's and cavalier's <i>Remove Fear</i> spells to only, well, remove existing fear effects.  In return, clerics (and paladins) get access to <i>Cloak of Bravery</i>, a fourth circle spell that does what <i>Remove Fear</i> does now.</p>
  <p>There is an indication that this was how the <i>Remove Fear</i> spell was actually supposed to work, and it is in line with its P&amp;P counterpart.  Also noteworthy is that <i>Horror</i> is actually non-canon, the P&amp;P spell <i>Fear</i> is 4th circle just like the clerical <i>Cloak of Fear</i>.</p>

    <tr><th>Design Notes</th><td>Gimme my fiery explosions, damn it!</i></td></th>
    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>This component will introduce the true Meteor Swarm spell as described in the 2e Player's Handbook; four 10d4 fireballs the caster can launch at up to four targets.  The existing Meteor Swarm spell will be renamed to Rain of Destruction.  The new spell scroll is available from the Arcana Archives.  Enemies will keep using the old spell, and it will remain available to players too.</p>

    <tr><th>Design Notes</th><td>Time Stop melee is cheap.</td></th>
    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>This component makes it impossible to deal damage to time-stopped creatures, they will be 100% resistant to everything.  This is mostly to prevent the incredibly cheap Time Stop melee tactic.</p>
  <p>This is also in line with the 3e version of <i>Time Stop</i>, where it can only be used to buy the caster a few rounds of preparation.</p>

    <tr><th>Design Notes</th><td>Time Stop melee is cheap.</td></th>
    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>This tweak will remove immunity to Time Stop from all creatures.  Casters remain of course immune to their own Time Stop spells.  It is designed to complement the previous tweak.</p>
  <p>There is absolutely no canon base for this immunity, it seems completely arbitrary and makes no sense considering how the spell is supposed to work.</p>

    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>This is a collection of minor tweaks to various spells.  Others may be added in the future as I feel like it.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Protection from Normal Missiles: In addition to its usual effects, this spell will now reduce missile damage to the recipient by 50%.</li>
  <li>Wyvern Call: The wyvern called will now be an 11 HD greater wyvern similar to those encountered in Durlag's Tower.  Very high-level casters will call up to three wyverns.</li>
  <li>Magical Stone: The stone deals double damage to undead (as per P&amp;P) and the priest gets an additional stone at levels 4 and 7.</li>
  <li>Shillelagh: The Shillelagh is treated as a magical club with a +1 enhancement bonus and no penalty for non-proficiency.</li>
  <li>Barkskin: If the recipient already has a better armor class than what the spell gives, they will still get an AC bonus of +1 to +5.</li>
  <li>Flame Blade: The flaming sword is treated as a magical scimitar with no penalty for non-proficiency.  It can strike any target not immune to fire with a +4 to hit and deals 1d8 points of fire damage, +1 for every two levels.  Strength does not apply.</li>

    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>This small component revises the experience gained from writing new spells to the spellbook to more sane values, making it actually worth doing in BG1 while toning down the ridiculous values in BG2.  This is similar to the component from BGT Tweaks.  The XP gains are as follows: 50/100/200/500/1000/2000/3000/4000/5000.</p>

    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>This component expands the services of all temples in the game.  You can now purchase the spells Cure Disease and Restoration at most temples.  If you installed Spell Restorations from MiH F&amp;R, Cure Blindness/Deafness will be available as well, and if you installed the Divine Spellpack from this mod, Break Enchantment will also be added.</p>

    <tr><th>Target Games</th><td>SoD</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Mod Compatibility</th><td>No known issues.</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Design Notes</th><td>None.</td></th>
    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>Five sixths circle spells were actually in Tales of the Sword Coast, although not usable by the player: Invisible Stalker, Globe of Invulnerability, Tenser's Transformation, Flesh to Stone and Death Spell.  Now that Siege of Dragonspear extends the story, it seems only fair to let the player actually have these spells.</p>
  <p>This will be most helpful if you have a mod that removes the XP cap so your wizard actually can reach level twelve and have a sixth circle spell slot, but even if not they can still use the scrolls.  One copy of each is available at the Sorcerous Sundries (only after SoD starts), and at quartermaster Belegarm in the camp.</p>

    <tr><th>Mod Compatibility</th><td>No known issues.</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Design Notes</th><td>None.</td></th>
    <tr><th>Description</th>
<td>
  <p>There's a huge gap between when clerics get Animate Dead and when wizards do, and for a 5th circle spell is is unimpressive.  In D&amp;D 3e, this spell is moved to the fourth circle, this modification implements that same change.</p>
  <p>The fifth circle spell is renamed <i>Dance Macabre</i> and now summons ghouls instead, and a new fourth circle <i>Animate Dead</i> is now available to wizards, sorcerers and bards.</p>

<h2>Expert Configuration Options</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Within the mod folder, there is a file called mih_sp.ini.  This file can be used to fine-tune certain aspects of this mod.  It is meant as an expert option; for normal installation you can leave this file as it is.  If you do edit this file, you must reinstall the mod, or at least the components for which you changed settings.</p>
  <p>Which spells get installed by the spell packs is determined by the file tables/spells.2da in the subdir folders of the components.  It is possible to add your own spells here.  The spell file goes in the subdir spells and the icons go into graphics.  There are other similar tables that control the installation of things like summoned creatures and simple items like paws.  You can also delete a spell you really don't like here, but this may have unexpected results down the line so be careful.</p>
