  <p><strong>Version 5 - <a href="https://github.com/AngelGryph/MadeInHeaven_SpellPack/releases/">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br/>
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br/>
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is my spell pack for Baldur's Gate 1 and -2.  It introduces several new arcane and divine spells to the game, as well as some new options for paladins.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games.
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  The core components have no known compatibility issues with any mods.  The tweaks might conflict with other mods that do similar things, like Spell Revisions.  As a spell pack, this mod should be installed fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br/>
  If you have an older version of the MiH Spell Pack, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br/>
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br/>
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must either run a 'modmerge' or install 'A7-DlcMerger' before installing this mod (or any WeiDU-based mods, really).  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br/>
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br/>
Made in Heaven: Spell Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mih_sp folder and setup-mih_sp.exe. To install, double-click setup-mih_sp.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mih_sp.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mih_sp.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br/>
    Made in Heaven: Spell Pack is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mih_sp folder, setup-mih_sp, and setup-mih_sp.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mih_sp.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br/>
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (e.g. /usr/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mih_sp.debug mih_sp/setup-mih_sp.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Spell Pack are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br/>
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod will have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component Descriptions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <h3>Core Components</h3>
  <p>This mod consists of several components, each of which can be installed or removed independently from the others.<p>
  <p><strong>Arcane Spell Pack</strong><br/>
  This installs new spells for wizards and bards.  The spells will be available on the selection screen when creating a new character, and spell scrolls are distributed throughout the environment.</p>
  <p><a href="arcane_spell_list.html">Arcane Spell List</a></p>

  <p><strong>Divine Spell Pack</strong><br/>
  This installs new spells for clerics and druids.  The new spells will be added to the spell list as the characters level up, just like other spells for these classes.</p>
  <p><a href="divine_spell_list.html">Divine Spell List</a></p>

  <p><strong>Paladin Powers Pack</strong><br/>
  This component revises and extends paladin powers as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All good paladins are immune to disease.</li>
    <li>True paladins, cavaliers and inquisitors can Smite Evil once per day.  Undead hunters can Smite Undead instead, and blackguards can Smite Good.  The smite deals 1d6 magical damage for every 3 paladin levels.</li>
    <li>True paladins and cavaliers gain an extra use of Lay on Hands every 7th level (max. 5 at level 28).</li>
    <li>True paladins and cavaliers can Cure Disease once per day starting at 2nd level.  At 6th level they can do this twice per day.</li>
    <li>Paladins can start casting divine spells at 4th level.</li>
    <li>Paladins can opt to gain an extra use of Lay on Hands or Smite Good/Evil/Undead as a high-level ability.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Spell Effect Tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>Split up Resist Fire/Cold <i>(EXPERIMENTAL)</i></strong><br/>
  This component restores the dummied out Resist Cold spell, separating this function from the Resist Fire/Cold spell (which is internally known as CLERIC_RESIST_FIRE only).</p>

  <p><strong>Restore Cure Blindness/Deafness <i>(EXPERIMENTAL)</i></strong><br/>
  This component restores the dummied out Cure Blindness/Deafness spell, separating this function from the Cure Disease spell.  The stronger Neutralize Poison will still retain its ability to cure blindness and deafness.</p>

  <p><strong>Level 4 Animate Dead for Wizards <i>(EXPERIMENTAL)</i></strong><br/>
  This makes Animate Dead a fourth level spell for wizards.  This only works if the character hasn't learned Animate Dead yet.  The fifth level version remains available and enemy spell lists are not affected.</p>

  <p><strong>True Meteor Swarm</strong><br/>
  This tweak will introduce the true Meteor Swarm spell as described in the 2e Player's Handbook; four 10d4 fireballs the caster can launch at up to four targets.  The existing Meteor Swarm spell will be renamed to Rain of Destruction.  The new spell scroll is available from the Arcana Archives.  Enemies will keep using the old spell, and it will remain available to players too.</p>

  <p><strong>Protection from Evil Block Domination</strong><br/>
  Per P&amp;P rules, the various Protection from Alignment spells should block domination effects, but in Baldur's Gate, Protection from evil doesn't do this.  This tweak makes it so.  Note that it does <i>not</i> prevent charm effects.</p>

  <p><strong>Prevent Damage during Time Stop</strong><br/>
  This tweak makes it impossible to deal damage to time-stopped creatures, they will be 100% resistant to everything.  This is mostly to prevent the incredibly cheap Time Stop melee tactic.</p>

  <p><strong>Remove All Time Stop Immunity</strong><br/>
  This tweak will remove immunity to Time Stop from all creatures.  Casters remain of course immune to their own Time Stop spells.</p>

  <p><strong>No Elemental Mind Battle</strong><br/>
  This removes the three-round "mind battle" from the arcane versions of the Conjure Elemental spells., making these spells actually useful.</p>

  <p><strong>Extended Animal/Monster Summoning Tables</strong><br/>
  Tired of seeing the same creatures every time you use an Animal- or Monster Summoning X spell?  Most tables only have four entries, and some (Monster Summoning III) have only two.  This modification extends these tables with a few more entries (up to seven in most cases).  This affects the vanilla spells Monster Summoning I-III and Animal Summoning I-II.</p>
  <p>If you restored Monster Summoning IV through the Spell Restorations component of this mod this component affects it too, but if you got it from another source it might not, depending on whether it actually uses the table or not.  Monster Summoning V-VII are not changed by this component even if you got them from this mod.  (Their summoning tables were broken and had to be rewritten from scratch.).</p>

  <p><strong>Spell Level affects Saving Throws</strong><br/>
  Under second edition rules, a ninth circle spell cast by an archmage is no more difficult to save against than a first circle spell cast by a goblin adept.  This was changed in third edition where higher circle spells are more difficult to save against.  This modification backports that rule by tacking on a saving throw penalty to spells equal to the spell circle minus one.  So a first circle spell has no penalty, a fourth circle one has a -3 penalty, and a ninth circle spell has a -8 penalty.  This is cumulative with any penalty the spell might already carry, so a fifth circle spell that already had a -2 to saving throws would get a -6 penalty instead.</p>
  <p>This can be combined with Tweaks' "save penalties for powerful spellcasters", but this will make high-level spells by powerful spellcasters very difficult to save against indeed.  They can be installed in any order.</p>

  <p><strong>Spell Improvements</strong><br/>
  This is a collection of minor tweaks to various spells.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Larloch's Minor Drain: This spell will now slightly scale with level, draining 1d4 +1/level hit points from the target (+10 maximum).</li>
  <li>Shillelagh: The Shillelagh is treated as a magical club with a +1 enhancement bonus and no penalty for non-proficiency.</li>
  <li>Barkskin: If the recipient already has a better armor class than what the spell gives, they will still get an AC bonus of +1 to +5.</li>
  <li>Flame Blade: The flaming sword is treated as a magical scimitar with no penalty for non-proficiency.  It can strike any target not immune to fire with a +4 to hit and deals 1d8 points of fire damage, +1 for every two levels.  Strength does not apply.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spell Availability Tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>Expanded Temple Services</strong><br/>
  This component expands the services of all temples in the game.  You can now purchase the spells Cure Disease and Restoration at most temples.  If you installed Spell Restorations, Cure Blindness/Deafness will be available as well, and if you installed Divine Spells, Break Enchantment will also be added.</p>
  <p>In addition, this component restores a bunch of dummied out priestly spell scrolls and makes them available for purchase at temples.  These include Cure Light/Serious/Critical Wounds and a couple of buffing spells.</p>

  <p><strong>Thalantyr the *Conjurer*</strong><br/>
  Thalantyr of Beregost is both canonically and in-game a Conjurer, but you cannot tell by his selection of spells for sale.  This component actually gives him a couple of scrolls from the conjuration school, and removes scrolls he wouldn't be able to make due to his barred school of divination.</p>
  <p>TODO: Give him more appropriate guardians than flesh golems.</p>

  <p><strong>Sixth Circle Spell Scrolls in Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br/>
  Five sixths circle spells were actually in Tales of the Sword Coast, although not usable by the player: Invisible Stalker, Globe of Invulnerability, Tenser's Transformation, Flesh to Stone and Death Spell.  Now that Siege of Dragonspear extends the story, it seems only fair to let the player actually have these spells.  This will be most helpful if you have a mod that removes the XP cap so your wizard actually can reach level twelve and have sixth circle spell slot, but even if not they can still use the scrolls.  One copy of each is available at the Sorcerous Sundries (only after SoD starts), and at quartermaster Belegarm in the camp.</p>

<h2>The .ini File</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Within the mod folder, there is a file called mih_sp.ini.  This file can be used to fine-tune certain aspects of this mod.  It is meant as an expert option, for normal installation you can leave this file as it is.  If you do edit this file, you must reinstall the mod, or at least the components whose settings you changed.</p>
