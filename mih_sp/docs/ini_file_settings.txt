debug_variable=0
use_perl_natively=0
disable_ssl=0

Don't touch these.  Seriously, just don't.

===

hitpoint_percentage=100

Affects how many HP per HD creatures get when their HD are adjusted.

===

use_ee_half_damage=1

Whether or not to use EE-style save for half damage.  Setting this to zero
uses oBG style instead.  Forced to zero on oBG games, for obvious reasons.

===

infinity_animations=0

Whether to use Infinity Animations on oBG games.  Requires Infinity Animations
to be installed with at least all the Icewind Dale animations or your game
will crash.  Support for this is and probably will remain experimental.

===

implement_lore_changes=1

Whether or not to implement lore-friendly changes when installing certain
components.  Components will assume this is in effect, so without it some
things will look strange and some content may not be accessible in-game.

===

recycle_unused_idsnames=1

Controls whether to clean up spell.ids of unused entries after installing
restored spells.  Recommended.  Note that EET also does this automatically.
(There is no harm in doing it twice.)
