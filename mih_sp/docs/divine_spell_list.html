  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>When this spell is placed upon a creature by a priest, the creature's body is toughened to withstand acidic and corrosive fluids and gasses. Mild corrosives cannot harm the subject at all. The recipient can somewhat resist intense acids and corrosives (whether natural or magical in origin), such as: Melf's Acid Arrow, Vitriolic Sphere, Death Fog, Acid Storm, the touch of various slimes and puddings, ankheg spittle and the breath of black- or green dragons.  In all of these cases, the corrosive agent affects the creature to some extent. The recipient has all damage sustained by acid or poison reduced by 50%.  Note that they can however still be poisoned, although the spell does grant a +3 bonus to the saving throw.</p>

  <p>This spell causes the recipient's life energy to surge, making her perform at a higher level than she actually is.  Base THAC0 is improved by 10%, and the recipient's hit points are raised by 10%, this may cause the recipient to have more hit points than her current maximum.

  Range: Visual sight of <br />caster
  Duration: 1 turn/level<br />
  Casting Time: 1 round<br />
  Area of Effect: Special<br />
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>Upon casting a conjure water elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the elemental plane of Water, and a water elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster.  It is 60% likely that a 12-hit-dice elemental appears, 35% likely that a 16-hit-dice elemental appears, and 5% likely that a 24-hit-dice elemental appears.  The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain, or the duration of the spell runs out.  All of the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and no need to know the language of the summoned creature.  Unlike the mage elemental conjuring spells, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.</p>

  Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br/>
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>This spell affords the caster's entire party partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy Plane connections (such as vampires), and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The Negative Plane Protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy Plane, possibly offsetting the effects of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell. The protected creature suffers only normal Hit Point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy Plane.</p>
