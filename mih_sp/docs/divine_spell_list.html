Range: Touch<br/>
Duration: 1 turn/level<br/>
Casting Time: 8<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Upon casting this spell, the priest bestows a powerful protection on the recipient.  For the duration of the spell, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will have all the immunities and resistances of a celestial creature such as a deva or planetar.  These are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>50% resistance to acid, cold and electricity.</li>
    <li>Immunity to all kinds of poison and disease.</li>
    <li>Immunity to normal weapons.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This spell can only be cast by priests of good or neutral alignment.</p>

Sphere: All<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: Permanent<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell allows a priest to store three spells and activate them both at the same time from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Special Ability button. All three spells must be of 4th level or lower. To create a exalted triad, a Priest must memorize not only Exalted Triad but also the spells &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; intends to store in it. After casting Exalted Triad, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has memorized.</p>

  <p>An exalted triad lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Ability icon also disappears until the next time a exalted triad is formed. A priest can possess only one Exalted Triad at a time, and it may not be given to other characters.</p>

Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell blesses the recipients with holy power.  This has several major effects.  All recipients gain a +2 to attack rolls and morale, like a double-strength Bless.  Evil opponents and undead get a -2 penalty to hit the recipients, and summoned fiends cannot touch them at all, similar to a Protection from Evil spell.  Finally good clerics get a +4 bonus to any attempts to turn undead.</p>

  <strong>Heroism (Alteration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 4<br/>
Sphere: Combat</br>
Range: Touch<br/>
Duration: 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 4<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell causes the recipient's life energy to surge, making &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; perform at a higher level than &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; actually is.  Base THAC0 is improved by 10%, and the recipient's hit points are raised by 10%, this may cause the recipient to have more hit points than &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; current maximum.  Any damage taken reduces these magically gained hit points first, if any remain after the spell expires these will be lost, but the recipient will not take any additional damage.</p>

  <p><img src="images/cleric_holly_dart.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Holly Dart (Evocation, Alteration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 7<br/>
Sphere: Plant<br/>
Range: 70 yds<br/>
Duration: Instantaneous<br/>
Casting Time: 8<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: Special</p>

  <p>This spell transforms a sprig of holly into a deadly missile, which can be thrown like a dart with a +6 bonus to the attack roll and no penalty for non-proficiency.  If struck, the target must save versus death at a -6 penalty or die instantly.  On a successful save, the target still takes 2d8+1 points of damage.</p>

  <p><img src="images/cleric_ice_storm.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Ice Storm (Evocation)</strong></p>

Range: Visual range of the caster<br/>
Duration: 4 rounds<br/>
Casting Time: 4<br/>
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>The druid must be outdoors to cast Ice Storm, or it will not work and the spell is wasted.  Upon casting, great hail stones pound down for four rounds in a 30-ft. diameter area and inflict 2d8 points of cold damage to any creatures within the area of effect. Also, anyone that remains within the area of effect takes 2d8 cold damage each round for 4 rounds.</p>

Casting Time: 5<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: Special</p>

  <p>Upon completion of this spell, the target bursts into flames, taking 6d6 points of fire damage with no save.  Each round thereafter, the flames continue to burn, dealing one die less of additional fire damage. Thus, the victim takes 5d6 fire damage on the second round, 4d6 on the third and so on, until the victim makes a successful save versus spell or the spell burns out after six rounds.</p>

  <p><img src="images/cleric_lightning_storm.png" align="right" />

Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: All enemies in sight<br/>
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

  <p>Lightning Storm must be cast outside; otherwise, it will not work, and the spell is wasted.  Upon completion, all creatures within visual range that are hostile to the caster are simultaneously struck by lightning for 6d12 points of electrical damage, even if they are hidden or invisible.  They may attempt a saving throw versus Spell for half damage.</p>

  <p><img src="images/cleric_magic_vestment.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Magic Vestment (Enchantment/Charm)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 3<br/>

Duration: 5 rounds/level<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: The caster<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell enchants the caster's vestment, providing protection at least the equivalent of chain mail (AC 5).  The vestment gains +1 enchantment for each three levels of the priest beyond 5th level, to a maximum of AC 0 at 20th level.</p>

  <p>If the vestment is worn with other armors, only the best Armor Class is used; this protection is not cumulative with armors or bracers of defense, although it can be used together with a shield and a ring- or cloak of protection.</p>

  <p><img src="images/cleric_mass_negative_plane_protection.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Mass Negative Plane Protection (Abjuration)</strong></p>

Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 10 rounds<br/>
Casting Time: 7<br/>
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell affords the caster's entire party partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy Plane connections (such as vampires), and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The Negative Plane Protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy Plane, possibly offsetting the effects of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell. The protected creature suffers only normal Hit Point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy Plane.</p>

  <p><img src="images/cleric_murderous_mist.png" align="right" />

  <p>The exact number of Poison Mists summoned depends on the druid's level:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>9-11: 1</li>
    <li>12-14: 2</li>
    <li>15-18: 3</li>
    <li>18+:   4</li>

Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>The effects of a Protection From Cold spell last no longer than 3 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster. When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to normal cold (snow, ice, near-freezing water, and the like) and to exposure to magical cold (frost dragon breath, winter wolf or cryohydra breath, spells such as Frost Fingers, Ice Storm, Cone of Cold, Otiluke's Freezing Sphere, Polar Ray, and so on), absorbing 80% of all the damage dealt by such magical sources.</p>

For the duration, the recipient has a +4 bonus on all to-hit rolls with ranged weapons.</p>
