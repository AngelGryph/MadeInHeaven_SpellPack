  <p><img src="images/hla_wizard_algarths_embattlement.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Algarth's Embattlement (Invocation/Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: Epic<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration:<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: The caster<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Also known as the Box of Spells, this spell allows a wizard to store spells in a magical ability (accessed via the Special Ability button) that is created by the spell. This item, the spell box, can store six spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 4th level or lower. A wizard can only possess one spell box at a time, and the spell box may not be given to other characters. Once the spell box is used, the icon will disappear from the Special Ability button.</p>

  <p><img src="images/hla_wizard_effulgent_epuration.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Elminster's Effulgent Epuration (Abjuration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: Epic<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 1 turn/level<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: The caster<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This powerful and long-lasting abjuration spell -a much stronger version of Spell Deflection- was developed by Elminster, the famous Sage of Shadowdale.  Up to one spell level per level of the caster will be harmlessly absorbed by this spell, with a maximum of 30 levels.  This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard as well as area effects that are stationary, such as cloud kill and stinking cloud.  As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be absorbed.  Something to note is that as long as there are levels remaining then the spell will be absorbed.  For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the spell deflection.  It is not affected by a dispel magic.</p>

  <p><img src="images/hla_wizard_ioulaums_longevity.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Ioulaum's Longevity (Necromancy)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: Epic<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: Instantaneous<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect:  15-ft. radius<br/>
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

  <p>By casting this horrid spell, the caster drains foes around &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self of 10d6+20 points of life.  These hit points are added to the caster's current total, with any hit points over their normal maximum treated as temporary additional hit points.  Any temporary hit points last for one hour.</p>

  <p><img src="images/hla_wizard_magic_missile_storm.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Magic Missile Storm (Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: Epic<br/>
Range: Visual range of caster<br/>
Duration: Instantaneous<br/>
Casting Time: 1<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This vastly improved version of the basic Magic Missile spell shreds the target with wave after wave of magically created missiles.  A total of 30 missiles will strike the target, dealing 30d4+30 points of damage.</p>

  <p><img src="images/hla_wizard_nazzers_nullification.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Nazzer's Nullification (Abjuration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: Epic<br/>
Range: Self<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This improved version of Dispel Magic will end any and all dispel-able magical effects around the caster from friends and foes alike.  Unlike Dispel Magic there is no level-based contest; anything that can be dispelled will be, including effects from potions and wands.  Note that the caster is the center of effect and thus will be subject of having &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; own magical protections dispelled.  This may leave &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; vulnerable to attack, so this spell should be used with utmost care.</p>

  <p><img src="images/hla_wizard_tolodines_killing_wind.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Tolodine's Killing Wind (Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: Epic<br/>
Range: 40 ft.<br/>
Duration: 1 turn<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br/>
Saving Throw: Special</p>

  <p>This improved version of Cloudkill creates a billowing cloud of horrendously toxic vapors.  Creatures with 10 hd or less are instantly slain with no saving throw unless they are immune to poison.  Creatures with 15 hd or less must save versus poison at -10 avoid being slain.  Every living being caught in the cloud takes 5d10 points of poison damage per round.  The caster must carefully target this spell or risk killing &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; allies or &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self.</p>

  <h1>Quest Spells (divine)</h1>

  <p><img src="images/hla_cleric_health_blessing.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Health Blessing (Necromancy)</strong></p>

Sphere: Healing<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 1 hour<br/>
Casting Time: 1 round<br/>
Area of Effect: 15' radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Casting this spell blesses the priest's party with good health.  Poison and disease will be cured and for the duration of the spell the party will be immune to all poisons and diseases.  They will also regenerate 2 hp per round and gain a +4 bonus on all saving throws versus poison and death.  Finally, each party member can cure hit points by laying hands like a paladin once per casting of this spell.</p>

  <p><img src="images/hla_cleric_interdiction.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Interdiction (Conjuration)</strong></p>

<p>Level: Quest<br/>
Sphere: Combat<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 1 turn<br/>
Casting Time: 1 round<br/>
Area of Effect: 15' radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>By means of this powerful prayer, the cleric brings good fortune upon &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; allies and doom to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; enemies.  After completing the spell all those friendly to the priest gain a +1 bonus to AC, hit rolls and damage rolls and a +2 to all saves, while &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; enemies get penalties.  This spell is not cumulative with itself but can be combined with similar spells like Chant, Prayer and Recitation for an even greater effect.</p>

  <p><img src="images/hla_druid_wolf_spirits.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Wolf Spirits (Conjuration/Summoning)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: Quest<br/>
Sphere: Animal<br/>
Range: 20 feet<br/>
Duration: 4 turns<br/>
Casting Time: 1 round<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>By casting this spell the druid conjures up a pack of spirit wolves to attack &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; enemies.  Six spirit wolves appear and fight for the caster until slain or the duration ends.  These spirits cannot be harmed by weapons less than a +2 enchantment and are immune to many effects including charm and hold.</p>
