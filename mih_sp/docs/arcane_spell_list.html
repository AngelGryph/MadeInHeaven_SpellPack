  <p><img src="images/wizard_alacrity.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Alacrity (Alteration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 3<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level<br/>
Area of Effect: The caster<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>The use of an Alacrity spell allows the wizard to speed up the casting of fifth level spells and lower.  All spells cast within the duration of the Alacrity spell are sped by 2 (so a spell with a casting time of 5 would have a casting time of 3 instead), lessening the change for the wizard to be interrupted and have &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; spell ruined.</p>

  <p>Alacrity cannot be used to speed up spells of sixth level and higher, and attempting to cast such a spell will end the Alacrity spell immediately.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_avissars_flaming_weapon.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Avissar's Flaming Weapon (Alteration)</strong></p>

<p>Level: 8<br/>
Range: Touch<br/>
Duration: 5 rounds/level<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

<p>This spell allows the wizard to temporarily imbue an ally's weapons with the power of elemental fire.  Each melee strike with an affected weapon will inflict 2d8 points of fire damage in addition to its normal damage and effects.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_barrier.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Barrier (Abjuration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 1<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 1<br/>
Area of Effect: Caster<br/>
Saving Throw: None<p/>

<p>The caster of the Barrier spell receives significant protection against melee and magical attacks.  This magical barrier is a force of energy that absorbs a portion of the damage intended for the caster.  At first level, the protection is 5%, and every five levels of the caster improves this by another 5%.  A 20th-level wizard would have 25% of her damage 'absorbed' if protected by this spell.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_blink.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Blink (Alteration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 3<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 1<br/>
Area of Effect: The caster<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Upon casting this spell, the caster starts rapidly winking in- and out of existence, making it difficult to engage &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; in melee.  However, the caster has no control over where and when &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; winks into existence, making it more difficult to strike opponents and possibly placing &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; in a dangerous situation.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_devastate.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Devastate (Alteration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 8<br/>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br/>
Duration: 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 8<br/>
Area of Effect: 15' radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This powerful spell weakens enemy defenses so that subsequent spells strike with devastating effect.  Opponents under the influence of this spell make all saving throws at a -5 penalty and have their resistances to elemental- and magical damage reduced by 30%.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_doom_legion.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Doom Legion (Necromancy)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 7<br/>
Range: 10 yards<br/>
Duration: 8 hours<br/>
Casting Time: 1 round<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Through this powerful necromantic ritual the necromancer animates the skeletal remains of soldiers slain in battle as a small squad of powerful skeleton warriors.  The spell animates two skeleton warriors at level 14, four at level 21 and finally six at level 28.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_evards_black_tentacles.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Evard's Black Tentacles (Conjuration/Summoning)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 4<br/>
Range: Visual range of caster<br/>
Duration: 1 turn<br/>
Casting Time: 4<br/>
Area of Effect: 40' radius<br/>
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

  <p>By means of this spell, the wizard calls forth a mass of writhing tentacles that grab on to any creature in the area, holding them in place and dealing 1d6+4 crushing damage per round.  A successful save versus spell allows a victim to escape, but as long as they remain in the area they may be grabbed again.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_faerie_sword.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Faerie Sword (Invocation/Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 7<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 1 round/2 levels<br/>
Casting Time: 7<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: Special</p>

  <p>This spell creates a slender, shimmering sword in the caster's hands.  The caster can wield this blade as well as a fighter of equal level with proficiency in longswords.  It can strike any opponent as if it were a +5 weapon, although there is no bonus to hit.  50% of the time, the sword inflicts 5d4 slashing damage on the enemy.  The other 50%, it randomly inflicts one of the following effects:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>8d4 fire damage</li>
    <li>10d4 acid damage</li>
    <li>turned to stone (allows save vs. petrification)</li>
    <li>mazed</li>
    <li>disintegrated (allows save vs. death)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_foresight.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Foresight (Divination)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 9<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 1 turn/level<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: The caster<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Casting this spell grants the caster a powerful sixth sense for danger.  While the spell is active, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will instinctively know when an attack is coming and what action to take (jumping, ducking to the side, closing one's eyes etc) to best avoid the attack.  Therefor, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; cannot be backstabbed and gains a +4 bonus to armor class and saving throws versus wand, -spell and -breath for the duration of the spell.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_frost_fingers.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Frost Fingers (Alteration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 1<br/>
Range: 5 ft.<br/>
Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 1<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

  <p>When the wizard casts this spell, a spray of numbing cold and ice crystals shoots from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; fingertips. The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fan-like sheet of flames: &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The frost fingers send out ice sprays of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. The target suffers 1d3 points of damage, +2 points for each level of the caster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of cold damage. A creature that successfully saves vs. Spell receives half damage.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_gust_of_wind.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Gust of Wind (Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 3<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 3<br/>
Area of Effect: 18-ft. cone with 60-deg. arc<br/>
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

  <p>This spell causes a sudden gust of wind blowing from the caster into the direction &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; indicates.  This wind blast is strong enough to knock humanoids and normal animals prone and send them tumbling away from the caster unless they save versus breath.  Giant humanoids will not be knocked prone, but will be momentarily unable to advance as they struggle against the wind.  This spell will also dissipate all gas clouds such as those produced by Stinking Cloud and Cloud Kill.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_heroism.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Heroism (Alteration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 3<br/>
Range: Touch<br/>
Duration: 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 4<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell causes the recipient's life energy to surge, making &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; perform at a higher level than &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; actually is.  Base THAC0 is improved by 10%, and the recipient's hit points are raised by 10%, this may cause the recipient to have more hit points than &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; current maximum.  Any damage taken reduces these magically gained hit points first, if any remain after the spell expires these will be lost, but the recipient will not take any additional damage.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_improved_magic_missile.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Improved Magic Missile (Invocation/Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 3<br/>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br/>
Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 3<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Like the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, Improved Magic Missile creates missiles of magical energy that dart from the wizard's fingertips and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort.  However, this spell creates up to eleven such missiles instead of only five.  The damage is still the same, 1d4+1 per missile.  For a caster below 11th level this spell works just like Magic Missile, but at 11th level &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; gets 6 missiles, then 7 at 13th level and so on up to 11 missiles at 21th level.  The Shield spell and other effects that specifically counter Magic Missile will also block the missiles created by this spell.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_iron_maiden.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Iron Maiden (Invocation/Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 4<br/>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br/>
Duration: 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 4<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This secret spell of the Harpers creates a construct known as a "helmed horror" which appears as an animated suit of armor wielding a flaming long sword.  The creature will fight as directed by the caster for the duration of the spell, after which it falls apart into worthless junk.  Because this is a construct created on the spot and not a creature conjured from elsewhere, the iron maiden is not vulnerable to effects that specifically target summoned creatures.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_khelbens_dweomerdoom.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Khelben's Dweomerdoom (Abjuration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 9<br/>
Range: 80 ft.<br/>
Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 2<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell allows archmages to drain magic directly from other wizards by eliminating the memory of certain spells.  The spell drains one wizard spell of any level from the target for every nine levels of the caster.  Neither a saving throw nor magic resistance can stop this assault, although spell trap, spell deflection and similar defenses can.  This spell has no effect at all on a target that isn't an arcane caster.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_major_globe_of_invulnerability.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Major Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 8<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 8<br/>
Area of Effect: 5' radius sphere<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, or 5th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Major Globe of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. 6th- and higher level spells are not affected by the globe, and magical attacks of 6th-level or higher, such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic, can bring it down.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_mass_charm.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Mass Charm (Enchantment)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 8<br/>
Range: Visual range of caster<br/>
Duration: 5 rounds<br/>
Casting Time: 8<br/>
Area of Effect: 15' radius<br/>
Saving Throw: Neg.</p>

  <p>This powerful spell affects humanoids, animals and giant humanoids.  Those who fail to save vs. spell (at a -2 penalty due to the power of this spell) regard the caster as trusted friend and ally to be heeded.  The caster may give them orders, which they will carry out as quickly as possible.  If the caster or one of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; allies attempts to harm a creature under this spell the charm is broken, but only for that creature.  A successful dispel magic spell can free all charmed creatures in its area of effect.</p>

  <p>If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.  Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was charmed.</p>

  <p>Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was charmed.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_minor_malison.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Minor Malison (Enchantment/Charm)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 3<br/>
Range: 50 ft.<br/>
Duration: 2 rounds/level<br/>
Casting Time: 3<br/>
Area of Effect: 30' radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>The spell allows the caster to adversely affect all the Saving Throws of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; enemies. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect. Opponents under the influence of this spell make all Saving Throws at a penalty of -2.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_mirage_arcana.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Mirage Arcana (Illusion/Phantasm)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 6<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 3<br/>
Area of Effect: 15' radius</p>

  <p>When a Mirage Arcana spell is invoked, the caster causes from 2 to 8 exact duplicates of themselves to come into being around the members of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; entire party. These images do exactly what the party members do. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual party member. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack -magical or otherwise- it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck. However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real person among all the images.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_mordenkainens_lucubration.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Mordenkainen's Lucubration (Alteration)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 6
Range: 0

  <p>This spell restores previously cast spells to memory so they may be cast again.  Up to three spells will be restored, one of which can be up to fifth level, one up to fourth, and the final one up to third level.  Only arcane spells can be restored.

  <p><img src="images/wizard_magnificent_mansion.png" align="right" />

  <p>Level: 7<br/>
Range: 0<br/>
Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Upon casting this spell, the caster and &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; party are instantly transported to an extradimensional mansion where they may rest, heal and do anything else one can do in a mansion.  Upon exiting the mansion, the party reappears at exactly the same spot from where they entered the mansion.</p>

  <p>This spell only works if the caster is currently on the prime material plane and will fail if used on any other plane of existence such as an elemental plane or outer plane.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_polar_ray.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Polar Ray (Invocation/Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 8<br/>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_ramaziths_slime_summons.png" align="right" />

Range: 120 ft.<br/>
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level<br/>
Casting Time: 7<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell was developed by the evil mage Ramazith of Baldur's Gate.  The mage casts this spell at a specially prepared foul brew which then comes to life as an ooze monster under &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; control.  There is a 50% chance that the ooze splits in two immediately after forming.  All oozes created by this spell will fight for the mage until slain or the duration elapses.  The exact type of ooze depends on the level of the mage.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>9th : gray ooze</li>
    <li>12th : ochre jelly</li>
    <li>15th+ : mustard jelly</li>
  </ul>

Range: 40 ft.<br/>
Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 3<br/>
Area of Effect: 30' radius<br/>
Saving Throw: 1/2</p>

  <p>This spell creates a burst of electricity, shocking anyone unfortunate enough to be in the area for 1d6 damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6).  A grape-sized sphere appears near the caster and travels to the designated point at a high velocity, where it bursts into the scintillating sphere.  Creatures failing their Saves vs. Spell take full damage from the shock.  Those who roll successful Saving Throws have managed to partially evade the blast and receive half damage.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_seeking.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Seeking (Enchantment/Charm)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 2<br/>
Range: Touch<br/>
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/3 levels<br/>
Casting Time: 2<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell slightly twists the normal laws of momentum and gravity in the recipient's favor, making &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; arrows, bolts or other projectiles veer towards their intended target, even dodging around obstacles if needed.  For the duration, the recipient has a +4 bonus on all to-hit rolls with ranged weapons.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_shooting_stars.png" align="right" />

Range: Visual range of the caster<br/>
Duration: Instant<br/>
Casting Time: 5<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Snilloc's Major Missile functions in most ways as the first circle spell Magic Missile, except that it fires only one large missile for increased damage.  The missile deals 10d4+10 damage, plus an additional 1d4+1 damage for every two levels over 9th, up till 20d4+20 damage at level 29.  It is otherwise identical to Magic Missile, and can be blocked by a Shield spell or a Brooch of Shielding.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_slumber.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Slumber (Enchantment/Charm)</strong></p>

Range: Visual range of the caster<br/>
Duration: 5 rounds<br/>
Casting Time: 4<br/>
Area of Effect: 15' radius<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>Slumber is a more powerful version of the first level spell Sleep.  When a wizard casts a Slumber spell, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more enemies (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects).  All creatures to be affected by the Slumber spell must be within a 15' radius.  Creatures in the area of effect fall asleep with no saving throw.  Monsters with 8 Hit Dice or more are unaffected. Attacks against sleeping opponents never miss.</p>

Range: Touch<br/>
Duration: 2 rounds/level<br/>
Casting Time: 5<br/>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell causes the recipient's life energy to surge, making &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; perform at a higher level than &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; actually is.  Base THAC0 is improved by 20%, and the recipient's hit points are raised by 20%, this may cause the recipient to have more hit points than &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; current maximum.  Any damage taken reduces these magically gained hit points first, if any remain after the spell expires these will be lost, but the recipient will not take any additional damage.  In addition to this, the spike of positive energy will render the recipient immune to fear and energy drain for the duration of the spell.</p>

  <p><img src="images/wizard_spell_matrix.png" align="right" />
  <strong>Simbul's Spell Matrix (Invocation/Evocation)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 5<br/>

Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: None</p>

  <p>This spell allows a wizard to store two spells and activate them both at the same time from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Special Ability button. Both spells must be of 3rd level or lower. To create a matrix, a Mage must memorize not only Spell Matrix but also the spells &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; intends to store in it (a Sorcerer can store spells of any level for which &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; still has spell slots). After casting Spell Matrix, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has memorized.</p>

  <p>A matrix lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Ability icon also disappears until the next time a matrix is formed. A wizard can possess only one Spell Matrix at a time, and it may not be given to other characters.</p>

  <strong>Weird (Illusion)</strong></p>

  <p>Level: 9<br/>
Range: 30 yards<br/>
Duration: 10 rounds<br/>
Casting Time: 9<br/>
Area of Effect: Special<br/>
Saving Throw: Special</p>

  <p>When casting the Weird spell, the mage informs &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; enemies that their final fate, indeed their doom is now upon them.  The spell then creates 1-4 weirds, quasi-real creatures made from shadow stuff.  While they appear only as blurry shadows to everyone else, their victims see the weird as whatever enemy they fear the most.  Although weirds are illusionary they cannot be disbelieved or dispelled by True Seeing and similar magic; the phantasm exists in the minds of the victims and is completely real to them for all purposes.  The only way to get rid of a weird before the spell ends is to defeat it in combat.</p>

  <p>Weirds attack twice per round and deal 2d8+4 damage on a successful attack.  In addition, with every hit the victim must save versus death at -4 or either flee in panic or be paralyzed with fear (50% chance of either),  There is also a 20% chance per hit that the victim dies instantly from pure fright.</p>
