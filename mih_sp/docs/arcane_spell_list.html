  Casting Time: 2<br/>
  Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>This spell slightly twists the normal laws of momentum and gravity in the recipient's favor, making her arrows, bolts or other projectiles veer towards their intended target, even dodging around obstacles if needed.  For the duration, the recipient has a +4 bonus on all to-hit rolls with ranged weapons.</p>

  Duration: Instant<br/>
  Casting Time: 3<br/>
  Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>Like the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, Improved Magic Missile creates missiles of magical energy that dart from the wizard's fingertips and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort.  However, this spell creates up to eleven such missiles instead of only five.  The damage is still the same, 1d4+1 per missile.  For a caster below 11th level this spell works just like Magic Missile, but at 11th level she gets 6 missiles, then 7 at 13th level and so on up to 11 missiles at 21th level.  The Shield spell and other effects that specifically counter Magic Missile will also block the missiles created by this spell.</p>

  Range: Touch<br/>
  Duration: 1 round/level<br/>
  Casting Time: 4<br/>
  Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>This spell causes the recipient's life energy to surge, making her perform at a higher level than she actually is.  Base THAC0 is improved by 10%, and the recipient's hit points are raised by 10%, this may cause the recipient to have more hit points than her current maximum.  Any damage taken reduces these magically gained hit points first, if any remain after the spell expires these will be lost, but the recipient will not take any additional damage.</p>

  Range: 0<br/>
  Duration: 1 round/level<br/>
  Casting Time: 1<br/>
  Area of Effect: The caster<br/>
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>Upon casting this spell, the caster starts rapidly winking in- and out of existence, making it difficult to strike her with any weapons.  However, the caster has no control over where and when she winks into existence, making it more difficult to strike opponents and possibly placing her in a dangerous situation.  For the duration of the spell, the caster's AC is improved by 4 and all physical attacks deal half their normal damage, but the caster has a -4 penalty to hit.</p>

  <p>This spell creates a burst of electricity, shocking anyone unfortunate enough to be in the area for 1d6 damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6).  A grape-sized sphere appears near the caster and travels to the designated point at a high velocity, where it bursts into the scintillating sphere.  Creatures failing their Saves vs. Spell take full damage from the shock.  Those who roll succesful Saving Throws have managed to partially evade the blast and receive half damage.</p>

  Area of Effect: Special<br/>
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>This secret spell of the Harpers creates a construct known as a "helmed horror" which appears as an animated suit of armor wielding a flaming long sword.  The creature will fight as directed by the caster for the duration of the spell, after which it falls apart into worthless junk.  Because this is a construct created on the spot and not a creature conjured from elsewhere, the iron maiden is not vulnerable to effects that specifically target summoned creatures.</p>

  <p>By means of this spell, the wizard calls forth a mass of writhing tentacles that grab on to any creature in the area, holding them in place and dealing 1d6+4 crushing damage per round.

  Area of Effect: Special<br/>
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>This spell allows a wizard to store two spells and activate them both at the same time from her Special Ability button. Both spells must be of 3rd level or lower.

After casting Spell Matrix, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those she has memorized.</p>
  <p>A matrix lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Ability icon also disappears until the next time a matrix is formed. A wizard can possess only one Spell Matrix at a time, and it may not be given to other characters.</p>

  <p>Few know the true terror of Baator, let alone the gruesome Fifth Layer. This devastating spell summons the harshest cold and bitter ice of the Fifth Layer of Baator, Stygia, to annihilate all enemies within range. As the River Styx flows through the Stygian Ice, so it does in this spell as well. Perhaps if the victims are strong enough to survive this devastation they may live to tell others about the true terror... but the River Styx has a tendency to make people forget.</p>
  <p>Ice from Stygia is summoned to crush all creatures within sight for 8d8 points of cold damage, with no saving throw.  Finally, all creatures must save vs. spell or suffer confusion for five rounds due to the immediate contact with the frozen, forgetful waters of the River Styx.</p>

This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. 6th- and higher level spells are not affected by the globe, and magical attacks of 6th-level or higher, such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic, can bring it down.</p>

  <p>When casting the Weird spell, the mage informs his enemies that their final fate, indeed their doom is now upon them.  The spell then creates 1-4 weirds, quasi-real creatures made from shadow stuff.  While they appear only as blurry shadows to everyone else, their victims see the weird as whatever enemy they fear the most.  Although weirds are illusionary they cannot be disbelieved or dispelled by True Seeing and similar magic; the phantasm exists in the minds of the victims and is completely real to them for all purposes.  The only way to get rid of a weird before the spell ends is to defeat it in combat.</p>
  <p>Weirds attack twice per round and deal 2d8+4 damage on a succesful attack.  In addition, with every hit the victim must save versus death at -4 or either flee in panic or be paralyzed with fear (50% chance of either),  There is also a 20% chance per hit that the victim dies instantly from pure fright.</p>
