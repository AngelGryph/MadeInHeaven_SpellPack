SFO (for 'stratagems functional overlay') is a large library of functions for WEIDU, collectively aimed at letting modders (mostly me, DavidW) write code at a rather higher level than WEIDU naturally allows and similary to manipulate IE files at a higher level. Code written in SFO is technically just code in WEIDU (modulo a few shorthand abbreviations), but SFO-style mods tend to look quite different 'under the hood': in effect, SFO functions as a sort of metalanguage for WEIDU.
</p>

<p>
(Technically, this is the second version of SFO. The first version (written around 2013) is the main metalanguage in which version 23 and later of my AI/tactical mod Sword Coast Stratagems were written. That version had similar design goals but is completely incompatible.)
</p>
<p>
SFO is not an especially polished or final product and these notes are written for my own benefit as much as anything else. But other people are more than welcome to borrow it for their own mods (an acknowledgement in your readme would be appreciated) and I hope these notes will help you to do so. They assume familiarity with WEIDU at about the level of my 'a course on WEIDU'.
