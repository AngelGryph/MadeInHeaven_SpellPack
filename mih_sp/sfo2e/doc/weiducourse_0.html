WEIDU is the standard tool used by the Infinity Engine (IE) modding community to build and install mods. It has a notoriously steep learning curve and (imho) there are no very good introductions to it: most people learn it by reverse-engineering existing mods, which is a great way to learn the practice but also leads to confusion, and can leave you ignorant of large parts of WEIDU’s capabilities (90% of mods use only 10% of WEIDU’s capabilities).</p>

<p>I intend this document as a course in basic-to-intermediate WEIDU. The level is somewhat uneven: <a href="weiducourse_1.html">Chapter 1</a> explains the basics of WEIDU without assuming any prior modding or programming experience, and I hope should be helpful to new modders. <a href="weiducourse_2.html">Chapter 2</a> is a more sophisticated and in-depth discussion, focussing on using WEIDU as a programming language (and de-prioritizing specific applications to IE games); I hope intermediate WEIDU users will find it a good way to get to the next step, and even advanced users might learn something. <a href="weiducourse_3.html">Chapter 3</a> discusses some specific programming tasks relevant to IE games; <a href="weiducourse_4.html">Chapter 4</a> discusses a few advanced techniques. The rest of this introduction provides a bit more context for the course, but you can skip straight to <a href="weiducourse_1.html">Chapter 1</a> if you like.</p>

<ul>
<li>WEIDU itself, obviously: see chapter 1 for how to get it.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://weidu.org.~thebigg/README-WeiDU.html">WEIDU readme</a>. The readme is not a great introduction to WEIDU, but it is the official reference, and you’ll end up consulting it a lot once you have the basics. See <a href="weiducourse_A.html">the appendix</a> for more details on its contents.</li>
<li>A good text editor. WEIDU is written in plain text documents: you can use Notepad if you like, but most people want something more sophisticated. (I use Notepad++.) It can be very helpful to use a highlighter: one for Notepad++ is available <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/NotePad_PlusPlus_WeiDU">here</a>, and others exist for other text editors. </li>
<li>Near Infinity, the standard tool for reading and editing Infinity Engine files. You can find the latest version <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/NearInfinity/releases">here</a>.</li>
<li>The "Infinity Engine Structure Description Project" (IESDP), the (technically un-)official documentation for Infinity Engine files. It’s online <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/">here</a> and you can download a local copy if you want.</li>

"WEIDU" is actually three tools packaged together: a tool for writing IE dialog files, a command-line tool for editing IE files, and a general-purpose modding tool. Historically the first of these was how WEIDU started out (officially ‘WEIDU’ stands for Weimer Dialog Utilities, named for its creator Wesley Weimer). This course is only a course in WEIDU as a general-purpose modding tool: it doesn’t cover command-line or dialog functionality. (Both are covered quite well by WEIDU’s readme.)
</p>
<p>
In addition, this is not a general course in Infinity Engine modding. I will assume at least some rudimentary familiarity with how IE games are structured: if you haven’t already, you should spend some time poking around BG2 in Near Infinity before reading on.
</p>
<p>
Finally, although both the IE games and WEIDU work on OSX, this guide assumes Windows.

I’m DavidW, a member of the <a href="www.gibberlings3.net">Gibberlings Three</a> modding community. I wrote, and maintain, the popular BG/BG2 mod Sword Coast Stratagems, and was design consultant on Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. I didn’t write WEIDU and don’t maintain it, but I have very extensive experience coding in it.
