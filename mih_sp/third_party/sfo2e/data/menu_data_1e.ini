text=This lists all functions that appear in the SFO 1e libraries, with the exception of the automatically-generated functions in sfo_autofunc.tph. (These functions have names like ARE_read_area_script and ITM_number_chargesGT; they are generated automatically for each field in an IE file type.) </p>
<p>All this is generated automatically and is legacy content: it's here largely to look up where an SFO1e function comes from.
