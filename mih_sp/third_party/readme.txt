All the code in this directory was written by other people and shamelessly
srolen- I mean, copied with thanks by me.  I did no editing on this at all
other than a bug fix or two which I reported back to the original authors.

Currently included here are:


From Sword Coast Stratagems v35.4, updated December 16th 2023:

iwdspells/	- Icewind Dale spells library, by DavidW.
sfo2e/		- SFO 2e function library, by DavidW.
                  Fixed bug with spl_copy and spl_make ignoring create_scroll.
lua/		- LUA GUI editing functions, by DavidW.


From G3 BG2 Fixpack v13, updated December 16th 2023:

lib/bg2fp_effect_batches	- Effect batches by CamDawg.


My sincere thanks to my fellow modders for all their help and hard work.
