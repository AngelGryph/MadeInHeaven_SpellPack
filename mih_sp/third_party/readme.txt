All the code in this directory was written by other people and shamelessly
stolen- I mean, copied with thanks by me.  I did no editing on this at all
other than a bug fix or two which I reported back to the original authors.

Currently included here are:

From IWDSpells master, updated February 9th 2024:

iwdspells/	- Icewind Dale spells library, by CamDawg & DavidW.


From Sword Coast Stratagems v35.19, updated August 29th 2024:

sfo2e/		- SFO 2e function library, by DavidW.


From G3 BG2 Fixpack v13, updated December 16th 2023:

lib/bg2fp_effect_batches	- Effect batches by CamDawg.


My sincere thanks to my fellow modders for all their help and hard work.
