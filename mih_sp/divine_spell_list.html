  Area of Effect: 1 creature<br/>
  Saving Throw: None
  <p>This spell causes the recipient's life energy to surge, making <PRO_HIMHER> perform at a higher level than <PRO_HESHE> actually is.  Base THAC0 is improved by 10%, and the recipient's hit points are raised by 10%, this may cause the recipient to have more hit points than <PRO_HISHER> current maximum.  Any damage taken reduces these magically gained hit points first, if any remain after the spell expires these will be lost, but the recipient will not take any additional damage.</p>

  <p>Lightning Storm must be cast outside; otherwise, it will not work, and the spell is wasted.  Upon completion, all creatures within visual range that are hostile to the caster are simultaneously struck by lightning for 4d12 points of electrical damage, even if they are hidden or invisible.</p>

  <p>Upon completion of this spell, the target bursts into flames, taking 6d6 points of fire damage with no save.  Each round thereafter, the flames continue to burn, dealing one die less of additional fire damage. Thus, the victim takes 5d6 fire damage on the second round, 4d6 on the third and so on, until the victim makes a succesful save versus spell or the spell burns out after six rounds.</p>

  Range: 0<br/>
  Duration: 10 rounds<br/>
  Casting Time: 7<br/>
  Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br/>
  Saving Throw: None</p>
  <p>This spell affords the caster's entire party partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy Plane connections (such as vampires), and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The Negative Plane Protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy Plane, possibly offsetting the effects of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell. The protected creature suffers only normal Hit Point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy Plane.</p>
