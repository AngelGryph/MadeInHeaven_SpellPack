// This function goes through a (compiled) dialog file, extracts the string
// references of all JOURNAL, SOLVED_JOURNAL and UNSOLVED_JOURNAL entries,
// and makes sure they get deleted from the journal during the transfer into
// BG2.  If called on a non-BGT game (including EET), it does nothing at all.
